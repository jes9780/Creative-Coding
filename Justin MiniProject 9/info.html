    The Kid LAROI - the newly eighteen year old rapper/singer born Charlton Howard is proving that for an incoming generation filled with promising talent, yesterday’s borders aren’t today’s barriers.<br>
    Born and raised in Sydney (aside from a short stint in the countryside) to a mother of Aboriginal descent and a French father, LAROI was raised by his mother and his uncle in a gritty environment.<br>
    When they weren’t at The Fact Tree, a local youth center where they played video games and pool, LAROI and his friends were on the streets.<br>
    LAROI grew up consuming one of America’s most adored exports, listening to hip-hop and R&B icons like Tupac, Erykah Badu, The Fugees, Lil Wayne and Kanye West.
    He’s wanted to make music since he can remember, hoping to claim a spot in music royalty.<br>

    In 2016, after competing in a Triple J competition, LAROI earned the respect of a few industry execs whose support led him to performances on stages alongside the late JuiceWRLD, whom he considered a close friend and mentor.<br>
    “It’s really what I’ve always imagined... I always knew it was bigger than that,” LAROI says about his crossover success and finding an audience outside of Australia.<br>
    “I love everything I make. I take music super seriously, and I look at it as art,” says the teenage phenomenon.<br>
    With an undeniable belief in his potential and the fast-paced track record to prove it, LAROI, unexpected as his story is, is making it increasingly easy for the rest of the world to believe in him too.<br>
