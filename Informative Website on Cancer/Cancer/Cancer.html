    <h1>What is Cancer?</h1>
    <p>
      Cancer is a disease where the cells of the body grow at
      an uncontrollable rate and spread across the body.
    </p>
    <img src="cancer.html Images/cellDivision.png" alt="Cell Division" style="float:right;width:350px;height:350px;">
    <p>
      Cancer can start anywhere in the body, especially since the human body
      has trillions of cells that undergo constant cell division to replace old
      or damaged cells. Sometimes, the process of cell division breaks down and
      abnormal or damaged cells grow at an uncontrolled rate which can lead to
      the formation of tumors that are either cancerous(malignant)
      or not cancerous(benign). Cancerous growths can proceed to spread towards
      the surrounding tissues and organs and create cancerous growths on the
      surrounding tissues or organs. Benign tumors will not continue to grow and
      spread. But it should be noted that benign tumors that are in sensitive areas,
      like the brain, should be taken with caution, since even though the tumor
      will not grow, the size of the tumor can cause future complications.
    </p>
  <h3>Differences between Cancer Cells and Normal Cells</h3>
    <p>Cancer cells and normal cells differ in many ways. For example cancer cells:</p>
<div ul class="a">
      -grow in the absence of signals telling them to grow.
        Normal cells only grow when they receive such signals <br>
      -ignore signals that normally tell cells to stop dividing or to die
        (a process known as programmed cell death, or apoptosis)<br>
      -invade into nearby areas and spread to other areas of the body.
        Normal cells stop growing when they encounter other cells, and
        most normal cells do not move around the body <br>
      -tell blood vessels to grow toward tumors.
        These blood vessels supply tumors with oxygen and nutrients
        and remove waste products from tumors <br>
      -hide from the immune system.The immune system normally eliminates damaged or abnormal cells <br>
      -trick the immune system into helping cancer cells stay alive and grow.
        For instance, some cancer cells convince immune cells to protect
        the tumor instead of attacking it <br>
      -accumulate multiple changes in their chromosomes,
        such as duplications and deletions of chromosome parts.
        Some cancer cells have double the normal number of chromosomes.<br>
      -rely on different kinds of nutrients than normal cells.
        In addition, some cancer cells make energy from nutrients in a different
        way than most normal cells. This lets cancer cells grow more quickly <br>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Cancer cells depend on these behaviors to allow for them to live on and grow.
    </p>
      <h3>How Does Cancer Develop?</h3>
    <p>
      Cancer is a genetic disease that causes changes to our genetics that control
      how the cells function, more specifically the way the cells grow and divide.
      Genetic changes that cause cancer can happen because:
    </p>
    <ul class="a">
      -of errors that occur as cells divide <br>
      -of damage to DNA caused by harmful substances from the environment, such
      as chemicals in tobacco smoke or UV Rays <br>
      -they were inherited from your parents <br>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The body typically eliminates damaged cells as they get detected, but this
      automatic process declines in efficiency the older we get. This is also why
      cancer is more likely to happen as we get older.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each person’s cancer has a unique combination of genetic changes.
      As the cancer continues to grow, additional changes will occur.
      Even within the same tumor, different cells may have different genetic changes.
    </p>
    <h3>Types of Genes That Cause Cancer</h3>
    <p>
      The genetic changes that contribute to cancer tend to affect three main types
      of genes—proto-oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and DNA repair genes.
      These changes are sometimes called “drivers” of cancer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Proto-oncogenes are involved in normal cell growth and division.
      However, when these genes are altered in certain ways or are more active than normal,
      they may become cancer-causing genes (or oncogenes),
      allowing cells to grow and survive when they should not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tumor suppressor genes are also involved in controlling cell growth and division.
      Cells with certain alterations in tumor suppressor genes may divide in an uncontrolled manner.
      DNA repair genes are involved in fixing damaged DNA.
      Cells with mutations in these genes tend to develop additional mutations
      in other genes and changes in their chromosomes, such as duplications and deletions of chromosome parts.
      Together, these mutations may cause the cells to become cancerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      As scientists have learned more about the molecular changes that lead to cancer,
      they have found that certain mutations commonly occur in many types of cancer.
      Now there are many cancer treatments available that target gene mutations found in cancer.
      A few of these treatments can be used by anyone with a cancer that has the targeted mutation,
      no matter where the cancer started growing.
    </p>
    <h3>When Cancer Spreads</h3>
    <p>
      A cancer that has spread from the place where it first formed to another place in the body is called metastatic cancer.
      The process by which cancer cells spread to other parts of the body is called metastasis.
      Metastatic cancer has the same name and the same type of cancer cells as the original, or primary, cancer.
      For example, breast cancer that forms a metastatic tumor in the lung is metastatic breast cancer, not lung cancer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under a microscope, metastatic cancer cells generally look the same as cells of the original cancer.
      Moreover, metastatic cancer cells and cells of the original cancer usually have some molecular features in common,
      such as the presence of specific chromosome changes.
      In some cases, treatment may help prolong the lives of people with metastatic cancer.
      In other cases, the primary goal of treatment for metastatic cancer is to control the growth of the cancer or to relieve symptoms it is causing.
      Metastatic tumors can cause severe damage to how the body functions, and most people who die of cancer die of metastatic disease.
