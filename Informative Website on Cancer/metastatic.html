  <p>
    The majority of deaths (about 90%) associated with cancer are due to the metastasis of the original tumor cells to sites distant from the initial or primary tumor. Metastasis is the process by which cancer cells migrate throughout the body.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order for cells to move through the body, they must first climb over/around neighboring cells. They do this by rearranging their cytoskeleton and attaching to the other cells and the extracellular matrix via proteins on the outside of their plasma membranes. By extending part of the cell forward and letting go at the back end, the cells can migrate forward. The cells can crawl until they hit a blockage which cannot be bypassed. Often this block is a thick layer of proteins and glycoproteins surrounding the tissues, called the basal lamina or basement membrane. In order to cross this layer, cancer cells secrete a mixture of digestive enzymes that degrade the proteins in the basal lamina and allow them to crawl through.
  </p>
  <p>
    The proteins secreted by cancer cells contain a group of enzymes called matrix metalloproteases (MMP). These enzymes act as 'molecular scissors' to cut through the proteins that inhibit the movement of the migrating cancer cells. Once the cells have traversed the basal lamina, they can spread through the body in several ways. They can enter the bloodstream by squeezing between the cells that make up the blood vessels.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once in the blood stream, the cells float through the circulatory system until they find a suitable location to settle and re-enter the tissues. The cells can then begin to grow in this new location, forming a new tumor.
  </p>
  <p>
    The process of metastasis formation is very inefficient process but leads to the majority of deaths associated with cancer. This is because the number of cells that leave a tumor can be in the millions per day. Even if only a small fraction of the cells that leave a tumor are able to survive to form a new tumor, the large number of attempts means that a distant growth is likely to occur at some point
  </p>
  <p>
    Migrating cancer cells can die from a variety of causes, including:
  </p>
  <ul class="a">
    -Cells normally live tightly connected to their neighbors and the meshwork of proteins surrounding them. Detachment from the surface of other cells can lead to cell death. <br>
    -Cancer cells are often quite large in comparison to the cells that normally live in the lymphatic system or blood system. When they travel through the vessels they can get damaged or stuck, leading to cell death. <br>
    -Cancer cells can be recognized and destroyed by cells of the immune system <br>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Additionally, it is important to note that even if a cancer cell does not die, it does not mean that it will form a tumor. The cells may exist at locations far from the original tumor without multiplying enough to cause any problems

  <h3>Formation of Metastases</h3>
  <p>A metastatic tumor cell must successfully "set up shop" in a new organ to form a secondary tumor, this process is termed colony formation. The metastatic cell must create favorable surroundings within a hostile foreign environment that will allow for their growth and survival. This appears to be the make or break step in metastasis. In an experimental model of metastatic melanoma, more than 80% of injected cancer cells survived in the circulation and exited to the liver. Of these, only 1 cell out of 40 formed micrometastases within 3 days, and of those only 1 cell in 100 formed macrometastases within 10 days. Creating a friendly environment appears to be a difficult process that limits a metastatic cell's ability to form a secondary tumor.</p>
  <p>What makes colony formation such an inefficient step? The surrounding tissue (stroma) of the new organ will be very different from that of the original site and in most cases will be unfriendly to tumor cell survival. If the metastatic cell cannot change the new stroma into a more friendly environment, it will not successfully colonize the new site (for example, promote angiogenesis), and a secondary tumor will be unable to form. In these cases the tumor cells are said to be dormant: they do not die, but they are incapable of growing. Aquisition of additional mutations often allow these dormant micrometastases to overcome the difficulties they face in new tissues and to successfully colonize it, forming a true metastatic tumor.</p>
  <h3>Routes of Metastases</h3>
  <p>
    The circulatory system is the primary route of spread to distant organs, while lymphatic vessels provide a route to local lymph nodes, after which metastases often travel through the blood. While the circulatory system appears to be the most common route, the extent of lymphatic versus hematogenous spread appears to depend on the origin and location of the primary tumor. For example, bone and soft tissue tumors (sarcomas) spread primarily through the blood, while melanoma, breast, lung and gastrointestinal tumors spread through the lymphatic system. Transcoelomic spread is fairly uncommon, and appears to be restricted to mesotheliomas and ovarian carcinomas.In order for tumor cells to gain access to lymphatic or blood vessels, tumors need to promote the growth of these vessels into and around the tumor. Growth of blood vessels is called angiogenesis, and growth of lymphatic vessels is lymphangiogenesis.
