      I do the same thing I told you that I never would<br>
      I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could<br>
      Know that I can't find nobody else as good as you<br>
      I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey (oh)<br>
      I get drunk, wake up, I'm wasted still<br>
      I realize the time that I wasted here<br>
      I feel like you can't feel the way I feel<br>
      Oh, I'll be <p id="id1" class="fucked up">fucked up</p> <p
      class="p">if you can't be right here<br>
      Oh-oh-oh-whoa (oh-oh-whoa, oh-oh-whoa)<br>
      Oh-oh-oh-whoa (oh-oh-whoa, oh-oh-whoa)<br>
      Oh-oh-oh-whoa (oh-oh-whoa, oh-oh-whoa)<br>

      Know that I can't find nobody else as good as you<br>
      I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey<br>
      When I'm away from you, I miss your touch (ooh-ooh)<br>
      You're the reason I believe in love<br>
      It's been difficult for me to trust (ooh-ooh)<br>
      And I'm afraid that I'ma fuck it up<br>
      Ain't no way that I can leave you stranded<br>
      'Cause you ain't ever left me empty-handed<br>
      And you know that I know that I can't live without you<br>
      So, baby, stay<br>
      Oh-oh-oh-whoa (oh-oh-whoa, oh-oh-whoa)<br>
      Oh-oh-oh-whoa (oh-oh-whoa, oh-oh-whoa)<br>
      Oh-oh-oh-whoa (oh-oh-whoa, oh-oh-whoa)<br>
